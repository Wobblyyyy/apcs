yeah so here are the answers i guess? gl lol

## notice
these are NOT here so you can copy-paste stuff and turn it in - rather, this
my solutions to some of the problems, so if you're stuck on a concept, you can
see how something is implemented.

i can't FORCE you to not copy answers directly from here, but i'm going to kindly
ask that you don't - not only does it mean you won't learn what's going on, but
it'll look bad when you hand in homework you can't explain.
